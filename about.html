    <p>I'm also known as sdmix around the web, may sound a bit like a DJ, but I
    wouldn't try and hire me to play at your next club night, instead I'm a creative.
    I focus on interactivity, photography and film. Creating awesome user interface and
    journeys through products that customers love to use.</p>

<div class="flexi theme border-top-zigzag"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="spacer1 twhite">Making it up as I go along.</h2>
        <p class="spacer2 twhite">I like to dive into anything creative. The things I've done in my life shows that I'm
        not afraid to dive into the unknown, to learn by doing and to get the job done. I don't shy away from
        a challenge; in fact I thrive on them. I'm at my best when I'm around creative people, doing what they
        love to do. As an avid photographer, I've always shown my life through pictures; this year i hope to 
        transfer the skills i've accumulated  to the medium of film.</p>
