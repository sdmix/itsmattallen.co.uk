<div class="wrapper spacer2">
    <p>I&#x2019;m also known as sdmix around the web, may sound a bit like a DJ, but I
    wouldn&#x2019;t try and hire me to play at your next club night, instead I&#x2019;m a creative.
    I focus on interactivity, photography and film. Creating awesome user interfaces and
    journeys through products that customers love to use.</p>

<div class="flexi theme border-top-zigzag"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="spacer1 twhite">Making it up as I go along.</h2>
        <p class="spacer2 twhite">I like to dive into anything creative. The things I&#x2019;ve done in my life shows that I&#x2019;m
        not afraid to dive into the unknown, to learn by doing and to get the job done. I don&#x2019;t shy away from
        a challenge; in fact I thrive on them. I&#x2019;m at my best when I&#x2019;m around creative people, doing what they
        love to do. As an avid photographer, I&#x2019;ve always shown my life through pictures; this year I hope to 
        transfer the skills I&#x2019;ve accumulated to the medium of film.</p>
        <p class="twhite">They say:</p>
        <h3 class="twhite">&#x201c;Find a job doing what you love, and you&#x2019;ll never work a day in your life.&#x201d; &#x2014; Confucius</h3>
        <p class="twhite spacer2">This is what I do, and this is what I love.</p></div></div>
