    <p>I'm also known as sdmix around the web, may sound a bit like a DJ, but I
    wouldn't try and hire me to play at your next club night, instead I'm a creative.
    I focus on interactivity, photography and film. Creating awesome user interface and
    journies through products that customers love to use.</p>

<div class="flexi"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="spacer1 ttheme">Making it up as I go along.</h2>
        <p class="spacer2">I like to dive into anything creative. The things I've done in my life so far show's that I'm
        not affraid to dive into the unknown, to learn by doing and to get the job done. I don't shy away from
        a challenge, in fact I thrive on them. I'm at my best when I'm around creative people, doing what they
        love to do. I'm an avid photographer and like to show my life through pictures, the knowledge this has gained me
        I'm now transfering over to film, which I look to be improving on over the course of 2013.</p>
        <p>They say:</p>
        <h3>"Find a job doing what you love, and you'll never work a day in your life."</h3>
        <p>This is what I do, and this is what I love.</p></div></div>
