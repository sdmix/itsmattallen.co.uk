<h2 class="wrapper ttheme spacer1">Its Matt Allen</h2>
<div class="wrapper spacer2">
    <p>I&#x2019;m also known as sdmix around the web, may sound a bit like a DJ, but I
    much prefer dancing on the stage than choosing the beats, instead I&#x2019;m a creative.
    I focus on interactivity and user experience, enjoying my passion for photography along the way. 
    Creating awesome user interfaces and journeys through products that customers love to use.</p>

<div class="wrapper"><h2 class="spacer1 twhite">Making it up as I go along.</h2>
        <p class="spacer2 twhite">I like to dive into anything creative. The things I&#x2019;ve done in my life shows that I&#x2019;m
        not afraid to dive into the unknown, to learn by doing and to get the job done. I don&#x2019;t shy away from
        a challenge; in fact I thrive on them. I&#x2019;m at my best when I&#x2019;m around creative people, doing what they
        love to do. As an avid photographer, I&#x2019;ve always shown my life through pictures; this year I hope to 
        transfer the skills I&#x2019;ve accumulated to the medium of film.</p>
        <p class="spacer2 twhite">I am an extremely enthusiastic person with a 
        passion and vision that is always looking to the future. I keep on top 
        of the latest technology trends and I’m always looking for new and exciting 
        ways to incorporate this into my workflow.</p>
        <p class="spacer1 twhite">Taking on projects that always expand my skill 
        set gives me a new challenge and I am always looking to learn new abilities 
        to help me with my work. Due to this I have become much more than a designer, 
        I can also develop, manage and plan, helping out at all stages of a project. 
        While more recently beginning to run my own servers for things such as email and 
        hosting has given me experience of system administration as well as taking on open 
        source projects for the community.</p>

        <p class="twhite spacer2">This is what I do, and this is what I love.</p></div>

<div class="wrapper">
    <p class="spacer1">In 2012 I started working as a Digital Designer at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSkyB" target="_blank">BSkyB</a> working within <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_Bet" target="_blank">Sky Betting & Gaming</a>. Still working there now, I've been part of helping the company grow and expand from a medium Leeds based company to a huge international team, seporating away from Sky Plc and becoming independant before recently being aquired by The Stars Group. It's been a fantastic experience and I've had the pleasure of working with some amazing colleagues. I'm currently working as an Interaction Designer, working on a universal notification user interface however during my time here I've also worked on all of the Sky Betting & Gaming products but primarily the Gaming side. </p>
    <p class="spacer1">A couple of examples of the work I've done are redesigning the user interface for the Sky Poker tables in 2012-13 bringing them off Flash and into HTML5 Canvas, helping to launch Sky Casino in 2014 and being a key designer in launching the new web interface for Sky Vegas merging two seporate portals into one responsive interface in 2015 and lastely a project which I'm not allowed to talk about. I've also worked closely with game providers and 3rd parties to ensure design quality.</p>
    <p class="spacer1">I have a Bachelor of Arts (BAHons) in Interactive Design from the awesome University of Lincoln.</p>
    <p class="spacer1">Being an interactive designer means that I’m not only a creative, 
    but also part developer. I understand how code is written and the limitations of modern technology; this means that I don’t create un-needed complexity in my designs and I even produce early prototypes. I’ve become a wiz at using tools like vim and git to help me demonstrate my ideas to a wide audience quickly.</p>
    <p class="spacer1">In the past, I&#x2019;ve done many freelance photography shoots, focusing mainly on portraits/group shots, these
    skills then lead me to cinematography and diving into the world of video.</p>
