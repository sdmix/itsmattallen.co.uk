<div class="lower3 wrapper spacer3 opening-quote" style="position:relative;"><h2 class="thighlight">&#x201c;I like to create user focused designs and interfaces for the web and beyond. Currently working as an interactive designer at Sky Betting & Gaming. I'm a sucker for a fun game and lover a most movies. Gadget addict. Rollercoaster nutcase and a storm chaser fuelled almost entirely by tea and cake.&#x201d;</h2>
<h3 class="tlight">&#x2014; sdmix</h3></div>

<div class="wrapper spacer3 tshadow"><p class="tlight">For some reason many years ago I thought I was a bit different, so I used to use the alias "somethingdifferent", "mix" was added on if it wasn't available. As youu can imagine, that's quite long, so around 2006 it became sdmix and I've been stuck with it ever since.<p></div>
<div class="wrapper spacer3"><p class="tlight">While you're here take a look around to see a little more of what I do, the blog though has probably become an archive really as I doubt I probably won't of posted lately (maybe check my twitter instead).<p></div>

is an internet scrapbook which I document through the lens. It means in 50 years time I’ll be able
