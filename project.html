<h2 class="lower1 wrapper ttheme spacer1">Work & Projects</h2>
<div class="wrapper spacer2">
    <p class="spacer1">The work and projects I've been involved with are a great way to learn new things 
    and to get involved with interesting and inspiring new people. Here is a collection of my favourite work,
    both new and old, in no order whatsoever. So go dive in.</p>
    <p>This list is a work in progress at the moment as I continue to 
    update my site during this refresh. Each project will soon have it's own section 
    you can go digging around, with detailed backup work, theory and processes on how 
    it came to be.</p>

<div class="flexi">
    <h1 class="wrapper spacer1 ttheme">Sky Betting & Gaming (2012-present)</h1>
    <h2 class="wrapper spacer1">Sky Poker (2012-14)</h2>
    <h3 class="wrapper raise1 tnoitalic">Rebuilding the game client in HTML5</h3>
    <div class="nopad spacer1 large picture-project-skypoker"></div>    
    <p class="wrapper spacer1">Creating the future of the Sky Poker gaming client by recreating it's Flash client as a modern product with performace, UI design and easy future development the key deliverables. Being able to create features fast, release often and offer improvements based on user testing and feedback while keeping the design flexible, allowing customisation and giving users control over their gameplay was a difficult task to complete. Poker users don't like change, some also play 15 tables plus on a 19" monitor and have varing computer hardware ranging from basic laptops to high end desktops, they all needed to be considered and carefully thought out to make this product work how they expected online poker to work. The UI needed to work as well at a small size as it does fullscreen with the user having an easy to follow expeience regardless of their choice in window size. This meant trying every possible eventuality and making sure everything could be used and understood throughout gameplay.</p>

    <h1 class="wrapper spacer1 ttheme">My Free Time</h1>
    <h2 class="wrapper spacer1 ttheme">Photography (ongoing)</h2>
    <div class="wrapper nopad spacer1 large picture-project-photography wrapper"></div>    
    <p class="wrapper spacer3">I&#x2019;ve loved photography ever since I was old enough to pick up a camera. I like
    to capture the emotion of a moment, the memories of a lifetime and tell my story
    though the eyes of a camera lense. I often get out and about with my camera, you
    can see my photo stories over at my <a href="http://flickr.com/sdmix">Flickr page</a>

    <h2 class="wrapper spacer1">Batch Webfont (2013)</h2> 
    <div class="nopad spacer1 large picture-project-batchwebfont"></div>    
    <p class="wrapper spacer1">Turning some lovely icons into a pixel perfect web-font. 
    <a href="http://twitter.com/AdamWhitcroft">Adam Whitcroft</a> created the Batch icon pack
    which contains over 300+ beautifully crafted icons for you to use in your projects. Due to
    the awesomeness of these icons, I took up the task of creating the webfont to suppliment
    them. This involved turning the 300+ icons into pixel perfect font vectors. Using Adobe Illustrator
    and the Glyphs app I re-created his icons ready to be using in any web project and compatible with
    all major browsers.</p>

    <h2 class="wrapper spacer1 ttheme">Personal Branding (2011)</h2> 
    <div class="nopad spacer1 large picture-project-branding"></div>    
    <p class="wrapper">This is itsmattallen and sdmix all rolled into one.</p>
    <p class="wrapper spacer1">My personal branding has taken a long time and a
    large amount of effort to get correct. I required both an online style and a
    stamp/logo which I could use to watermark photography and use in projects. This
    ended up with me using 3 shapes that enclosed in the circle that you see at the
    top of this page.</p>
