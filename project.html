    <h2>Introducing immerse</h2>
    <p>The television interface you have been waiting for and the biggest change in the default interface styles since the introduction of the television itself. immerse is designed from the ground up to allow everyone to enjoy the TV and the free services available, without the need for any extra boxes.</p>
    <p>The problem these days is that everyone has different needs when it comes to their TV, some use it just for Blu-Rays, others just to watch the odd episode of Eastenders. There are those who can spot the pixel difference between High Definition and those who don’t know that accessing Netflix or Love Film via their sofa could be so easy! immerse changes that by merging directly with the television itself, so to begin with, you only have one remote, for everything.</p>
