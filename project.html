<h2 class="lower1 wrapper ttheme spacer1">My Projects</h2>
<div class="wrapper spacer2">
    <p class="spacer1">I like projects. They are a great way to learn new things and to get involved
    with interesting and inspiring new people. Here is a collection of my favourite work,
    both new and old, in no order whatsoever. So go dive in.</p>
    <p>This list is a work in progress at the moment as I continue to 
    update my site during this refresh. Each project will soon have it's own section 
    you can go digging around, with detailed backup work, theory and processes on how 
    it came to be.</p>

    <h2 class="wrapper spacer1 ttheme">Google Packs</h2>
    <a href="/projects/googlepacks"><div class="wrapper nopad spacer1 large picture-project-googlepack"></div></a>
    <p class="wrapper spacer3">Imagining Google products were sold on the high street. A company
    that has grown up on the internet has built a set of products that would fit in no other place,
    or would they? Google Packs brings the idea of a life with Google without their services 
    first starting on the internet. You buy the bits you need and get stuck in. Incorporating
    the latestest technology into a Google Identification Card (ID) you take it with you everywhere,
    it&#x2019;s your wallet, your loyalty cards, your business card. It gives you access to the services 
    you have subscribed to and lets you manage your online identity. It&#x2019;s the way Google could have been.

    <h2 class="wrapper twhite">immerse</h2>
    <a href="/projects/immerse"><div class="lower1 nopad spacer1 large picture-project-immerse"></div></a>
    <p class="wrapper spacer1 twhite">The television operating system of the future. Designed
    from the ground up to connect all your degital services into one, slick interface
    that makes making the most of your smart TV, simple. People don&#x2019;t like remotes, and
    normally with aditional services (like cable, Blu-rays and media streamers) they all
    require an extra box, and with that, an extra remote. immerse is designed to combine
    all those different ways to connect your media and build them into your TV.

    <h2 class="wrapper spacer1">Batch Webfont</h2> 
    <div class="nopad spacer1 large picture-project-batchwebfont"></div>    
    <p class="wrapper spacer1">Turning some lovely icons into a pixel perfect web-font. 
    <a href="http://twitter.com/AdamWhitcroft">Adam Whitcroft</a> created the Batch icon pack
    which contains over 300+ beautifully crafted icons for you to use in your projects. Due to
    the awesomeness of these icons, I took up the task of creating the webfont to suppliment
    them. This involved turning the 300+ icons into pixel perfect font vectors. Using Adobe Illustrator
    and the Glyphs app I re-created his icons ready to be using in any web project and compatible with
    all major browsers.</p>

    <h2 class="wrapper spacer1 twhite">My Design Manifesto</h2> 
    <div class="nopad spacer1 large picture-project-designmanifesto raise1"></div>    
    <p class="wrapper spacer1 twhite">I, the undersigned…</p>
    <p class="twhite wrapper spacer1">This is how I try to work. This is my design manifesto.
    A brief for my University degree. I was to create a personal manifesto that aligned 
    to my creative practice as a curious and enthusiastic design student. The content 
    and method in which it is presented became a public declaration of my intentions,
    beliefs and principles as an emerging designer at the time. I loved how this came
    out so much, I still try to live by these principles today. It&#x2019;s also a stupidly large
    poster on my wall, so it&#x2019;s hard to miss.

    <h2 class="wrapper spacer1 ttheme">Personal Branding</h2> 
    <div class="nopad spacer1 large picture-project-branding"></div>    
    <p class="wrapper">This is itsmattallen and sdmix all rolled into one.</p>
    <p class="wrapper spacer3">My personal branding has taken a long time and a
    large amount of effort to get correct. I required both an online style and a
    stamp/logo which I could use to watermark photography and use in projects. This
    ended up with me using 3 shapes that enclosed in the circle that you see at the
    top of this page.</p>
    </div>
    <h2 class="wrapper spacer1 ttheme">Photography</h2>
    <div class="wrapper nopad spacer1 large picture-project-photography wrapper"></div>    
    <p class="wrapper">I&#x2019;ve loved photography ever since I was old enough to pick up a camera. I like
    to capture the emotion of a moment, the memories of a lifetime and tell my story
    though the eyes of a camera lense. I often get out and about with my camera, you
    can see my photo stories over at my <a href="http://flickr.com/sdmix">Flickr page</a>
