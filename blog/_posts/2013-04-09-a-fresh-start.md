<h2 class="lower2 wrapper ttheme spacer1">This a fresh start.</h2>
<div class="wrapper spacer2">
    <p>Well now, howdy!</p>
    <p>So over the last few months to kick start my 2013 I've deciced to dive back
    into code and I thought the best way to do that was to rebuild my website from
    the ground up.</p>
    <p>I've learnt lots of new things recently, mainly thanks to the fantastic advice
    of <a href="http://csswizardry.com/" target="_blank">Harry Roberts</a> and his open
    source framework <a href="http://inuitcss.com/" target="_blank">inuit.css</a>. This has allowed me to
    make use of tools like vim and Sass, start version control on my website via GitHub
    and making use of OOCSS.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="lower2 wrapper ttheme spacer1">This site has been a learning curve.</h2>

<h2 class="lower2 wrapper ttheme spacer1">Help a Designer out.</h2>
<div class="wrapper spacer2">
    <p>My main skill set dives me deep into creativity, photography and film, not
    developing and therefore putting my site up on GitHub allows you to view my code
    and how I've done what I have here. So if you notice anything a bit wrong, or
    have any tips on ways I can keep on improving how I am doing things please drop
    an issue over there and allow me to keep this flow going.</p>
    <p>Although its quite obvious, my site is not open to be copied and still falls
    under the same <a href="http://copyright.itsmattallen.co.uk/" target="_blank">copyright</a>
    as all my other content which I place online. Please respect that. By all means
    dive through the code (especially if you're a designer!) and learn what you can
    from it, also make sure to check out the places I've learnt what I now know from
    (see above) if you are interested in diving into code.</p>
