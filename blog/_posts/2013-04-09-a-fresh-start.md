<h1 class="lower1 wrapper ttheme spacer1">This is a fresh start.</h1>
<div class="wrapper spacer2">
    <p>Well now, howdy!</p>
    <p>So over the last few months to kick start my 2013 I've deciced to dive back
    into code and I thought the best way to do that was to rebuild my website from
    the ground up.</p>
    <p>I've learnt lots of new things recently, mainly thanks to the fantastic advice
    of <a href="http://csswizardry.com/" target="_blank">Harry Roberts</a> and his open
    source framework <a href="http://inuitcss.com/" target="_blank">inuit.css</a>. Although
    I'm not using inuit.css as a framework for this website, the knowledge has allowed me to
    make use of tools like vim and Sass, start version control on my website via GitHub
    and making use of OOCSS.</p>

<h2 class="lower2 wrapper ttheme spacer1">The new identity. What can you expect?</h2>
<div class="wrapper spacer2">
    <p>So for those who have been here before and followed my old tumblr based portfolio
    and blog, some things will be similar. You'll notice however I've given my personal
    brand a nice kickstart and have written myself some style guidelines, I intend
    to write a blog post on in the future. I've now got full power over my code, so I'm
    hoping that the site is feeling snappier and more responsive. Speaking of which, you
    can view this site on all your devices and screen sizes, go ahead, grab the corner of
    your browser and shrink it down to see what happens.</p>
    <p>With all of this means I'll be able to post more to my style and brand, keep things
    in the right places, and give you guys a better reading experience. I do hope you a loving
    the big type in comparison to my old site!</p>
    <p>You can expect this blog to be filled with all sorts of cool posts, on design,
    development and awesome topics from the life itself.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="lower2 wrapper ttheme spacer1">Help a Designer out.</h2>
<div class="wrapper spacer2">
    <p>My main skill set dives me deep into creativity, photography and film, not
    developing and therefore putting my site up on GitHub allows you to view my code
    and how I've done what I have here. So if you notice anything a bit wrong, or
    have any tips on ways I can keep on improving how I am doing things please open up an
    issue over there and allow me to keep this flow going.</p>
    <p>Although its quite obvious, my site is not open to be copied and still falls
    under the same <a href="http://copyright.itsmattallen.co.uk/" target="_blank">copyright</a>
    as all my other content which I place online. Please respect that. By all means
    dive through the code (especially if you're a designer!) and learn what you can
    from it, also make sure to check out the places I've learnt what I now know from
    (see above) if you are interested in diving into code.</p>

<h2 class="lower2 wrapper ttheme">Signing off - Matt</h2>
