==================

The new home of sdmix (Matt Allen) on the big bad web. Going under the site itsmattallen.co.uk. 
Its a work in progress, using a mix of new coding practices and new techniques. Expect a lot of drama, 
mistakes and general learning to go on here.

<a href="http://github.com/csswizardry">Harry Roberts</a> has helped out with a lot of resources 
for this leap forward in coding for me, most of the tips you can get from reading through his github as he placed
his new site right here on GitHub for you to read through and the awesome <a href="http://github.com/csswizardry/inuit.css">inuit.css</a> 
meaning you too can dive in and look around.

He's also the main reason for me now using tools like vim, Jekyll and Sass, plus giving me the push 
to dive back into code from after being focused on design for so long due to my degree. He's a top bloke, 
go check him out.

My site is now live, you can go have a gander and read more about the launch on <a href="http://itsmattallen.co.uk/blog/2013/04/a-fresh-start/">my first blog post</a>.
