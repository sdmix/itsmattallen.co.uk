==================

The new home of sdmix (Matt Allen) on the big bad web. Going under the site itsmattallen.co.uk. 
Its a work in progress, using a mix of new coding practices and new techniques. Expect a lot of drama, 
mistakes and general learning to go on here.

I will slowly be replacing my current <a href="http://itsmattallen.co.uk">holding page</a> with the 
results of the code you find here. Until then, I will be working on a testing server which I will 
eventually place a link to <a href="http://test.itsmattallen.co.uk/">here</a>. After I've got enough content and features working, it will replace 
both my <a href="http://hello.itsmattallen.co.uk">portfolio site</a> and my 
<a href="http://sdmix.itsmattallen.co.uk">blog</a> with a lovely 2013 refresh. Smashing.

<a href="http://github.com/csswizardry">Harry Roberts</a> has helped out with a lot of resources 
for this leap forward in coding for me, most of which you can get from his github as he has open 
sourced his code for his new site and the awesome <a href="http://github.com/csswizardry/inuit.css">inuit.css</a> 
meaning you too can dive in and look around.

He's also the main reason for me now using tools like vim, Jekyll and sass, plus giving me the push 
to dive back into code from after being focused on design for so long due to my degree. He's a top bloke, 
go check him out.
