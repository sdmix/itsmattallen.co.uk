    <h2 class="wrapper spacer1">Title launching soon - Subsonic mobile client</h2> 
    <p class="wrapper spacer1">Coming in the future to iOS. I am designing and developing an app to make use
    of <a href="http://www.subsonic.org/pages/index.jsp" target="_blank">Subsonic</a> from your mobile phone.
    I will be aiming to create an app as feature rich as the default music app with all the internet capabilities
    of services like Spotify, giving users complete control over their music collection while on the go and at home.<p>
    <p class="wrapper spacer3">It will be design and UX focused and include help and support not only on the app but also
    to those who want to set up a service such as Subsonic for their own music collection, freeing them from the cost
    of media streaming services. More details will follow soon, app name to be released when domain is secured.</p>
